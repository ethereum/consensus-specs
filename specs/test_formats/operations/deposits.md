# Test format: Deposit operations

A deposit is a form of an operation (or "transaction"), modifying the state.

## Test case format

```yaml
description: string  -- description of test case, purely for debugging purposes
pre: BeaconState     -- state before applying the deposit
deposit: Deposit     -- the deposit
post: BeaconState    -- state after applying the deposit. No value if deposit processing is aborted.
```

## Condition

A `deposits` handler of the `operations` should process these cases, 
 calling the implementation of the `process_deposit(state, deposit)` functionality described in the spec.
The resulting state should match the expected `post` state, or if the `post` state is left blank, the handler should reject the inputs as invalid.
