# SSZ, static tests

This set of test-suites provides static testing for SSZ:
 to instantiate just the known Eth2 SSZ types from binary data.

This series of tests is based on the spec-maintained `eth2spec/utils/ssz/ssz_impl.py`, i.e. fully consistent with the SSZ spec. 

Test format documentation can be found here: [core test format](./core.md).
