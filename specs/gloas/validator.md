## Helpers

### New `GetInclusionListResponse`

```python
@dataclass
class GetInclusionListResponse(object):
    inclusion_list_transactions: Sequence[Transaction]
```

## Protocols

### `ExecutionEngine`

*Note*: `get_inclusion_list` function is added to the `ExecutionEngine` protocol
for use as an inclusion list committee member.

The body of this function is implementation dependent. The Engine API may be
used to implement it with an external execution engine.

#### New `get_inclusion_list`

`get_inclusion_list` returns `GetInclusionListResponse` with the most recent
inclusion list transactions that has been built based on the latest view of the
public mempool.

```python
def get_inclusion_list(self: ExecutionEngine) -> GetInclusionListResponse:
    """
    Return ``GetInclusionListResponse`` object.
    """
    ...
```

## Validator assignment

### Payload timeliness committee

A validator may be a member of the new Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC) for a
given slot. To check for PTC assignments the validator uses the helper
`get_ptc_assignment(state, epoch, validator_index)` where `epoch <= next_epoch`.

PTC committee selection is only stable within the context of the current and
next epoch.

```python
def get_ptc_assignment(
    state: BeaconState, epoch: Epoch, validator_index: ValidatorIndex
) -> Optional[Slot]:
    """
    Returns the slot during the requested epoch in which the validator with index `validator_index`
    is a member of the PTC. Returns None if no assignment is found.
    """
    next_epoch = Epoch(get_current_epoch(state) + 1)
    assert epoch <= next_epoch

    start_slot = compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch)
    for slot in range(start_slot, start_slot + SLOTS_PER_EPOCH):
        if validator_index in get_ptc(state, Slot(slot)):
            return Slot(slot)
    return None
```

### Inclusion list committee

A validator may be a member of the new inclusion list committee for a given
slot. To determine inclusion list committee assignments, the validator can run
the following function:
`get_inclusion_committee_assignment(state, epoch, validator_index)` where
`epoch <= next_epoch`.

Inclusion list committee selection is only stable within the context of the
current and next epoch.

```python
def get_inclusion_committee_assignment(
    state: BeaconState, epoch: Epoch, validator_index: ValidatorIndex
) -> Optional[Slot]:
    """
    Returns the slot during the requested epoch in which the validator with index ``validator_index``
    is a member of the inclusion list committee. Returns None if no assignment is found.
    """
    next_epoch = Epoch(get_current_epoch(state) + 1)
    assert epoch <= next_epoch

    start_slot = compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch)
    for slot in range(start_slot, start_slot + SLOTS_PER_EPOCH):
        if validator_index in get_inclusion_list_committee(state, Slot(slot)):
            return Slot(slot)
    return None
```

### Lookahead

*[New in Gloas:EIP7732]*

`get_ptc_assignment` should be called at the start of each epoch to get the
assignment for the next epoch (`current_epoch + 1`). A validator should plan for
future assignments by noting their assigned PTC slot.

*[New in Gloas:EIP7805]*

`get_inclusion_committee_assignment` should be called at the start of each epoch
to get the assignment for the next epoch (`current_epoch + 1`). A validator
should plan for future assignments by noting their assigned inclusion list
committee slot.

## Beacon chain responsibilities

All validator responsibilities remain unchanged other than the following:

- Proposers are no longer required to broadcast `BlobSidecar` objects, as this
  becomes a builder's duty.
- Some validators are selected per slot to become PTC members, these validators
  must broadcast `PayloadAttestationMessage` objects during the assigned slot
  before the deadline of `get_attestation_due_ms(epoch)` milliseconds into the
  slot.

### Attestation

The attestation deadline is changed with `ATTESTATION_DUE_BPS_GLOAS`. Moreover,
the `attestation.data.index` field is now used to signal the payload status of
the block being attested to (`attestation.data.beacon_block_root`). With the
alias `data = attestation.data`, the validator should set this field as follows:

- If `block.slot == current_slot` (i.e., `data.slot`), then always set
  `data.index = 0`.
- Otherwise, set `data.index` based on the payload status in the validator's
  fork-choice:
  - Set `data.index = 0` to signal that the payload is not present in the
    canonical chain (payload status is `EMPTY` in the fork-choice).
  - Set `data.index = 1` to signal that the payload is present in the canonical
    chain (payload status is `FULL` in the fork-choice).

#### Attestation data

*Note*: The only change to `attestation_data` is to call
`get_attester_head(store, head_root)` to set the `beacon_block_root` field of
`attestation_data`.

##### Modified LMD GHOST vote

Set `attestation_data.beacon_block_root = get_attester_head(store, head_root)`.

### Sync Committee participations

Sync committee duties are not changed for validators, however the submission
deadline is changed with `SYNC_MESSAGE_DUE_BPS_GLOAS`.

*Note*: The only change to `get_sync_committee_message` is to call
`get_attester_head(store, head_root)` to set the `beacon_block_root` parameter
of `get_sync_committee_message`.

#### `get_sync_committee_message`

##### Modified `beacon_block_root`

The `beacon_block_root` parameter MUST be set to return value of
[`get_attester_head(store: Store, head_root: Root)`](./fork-choice.md#new-get_attester_head)
function.

### Block proposal

Validators are still expected to propose `SignedBeaconBlock` at the beginning of
any slot during which `is_proposer(state, validator_index)` returns `true`. The
mechanism to prepare this beacon block and related sidecars differs from
previous forks as follows

#### Constructing the new `signed_execution_payload_bid` field in `BeaconBlockBody`

To obtain `signed_execution_payload_bid`, a block proposer building a block on
top of a `state` must take the following actions:

- Listen to the `execution_payload_bid` gossip global topic and save an accepted
  `signed_execution_payload_bid` from a builder. Proposer MAY obtain these
  signed messages by other off-protocol means.
- The `signed_execution_payload_bid` must satisfy the verification conditions
  found in `process_execution_payload_bid`, that is:
  - For external builders: The header signature must be valid
  - For self-builds: The signature must be `bls.G2_POINT_AT_INFINITY` and the
    bid amount must be zero
  - The builder balance can cover the header value
  - The header slot is for the proposal block slot
  - The header parent block hash equals the state's `latest_block_hash`.
  - The header parent block root equals the current block's `parent_root`.
- Select one bid and set
  `body.signed_execution_payload_bid = signed_execution_payload_bid`

*Note:* The execution address encoded in the field `fee_recipient` in the
`signed_execution_payload_bid.message` is the recipient of the builder payment.

#### Constructing the new `payload_attestations` field in `BeaconBlockBody`

Up to `MAX_PAYLOAD_ATTESTATIONS`, aggregate payload attestations can be included
in the block. The validator will have to

- Listen to the `payload_attestation_message` gossip global topic
- The payload attestations added must satisfy the verification conditions found
  in payload attestation gossip validation and payload attestation processing.
  This means
  - The `data.beacon_block_root` corresponds to `block.parent_root`.
  - The slot of the parent block is exactly one slot before the proposing slot.
  - The signature of the payload attestation data message verifies correctly.
- The proposer needs to aggregate all payload attestations with the same data
  into a given `PayloadAttestation` object. For this it needs to fill the
  `aggregation_bits` field by using the relative position of the validator
  indices with respect to the PTC that is obtained from
  `get_ptc(state, block_slot - 1)`.

#### Blob sidecars

The blob sidecars are no longer broadcast by the validator, and thus their
construction is not necessary. This deprecates the corresponding sections from
the honest validator guide in the Fulu fork, moving them, albeit with some
modifications, to the [honest Builder guide](./builder.md)

### Inclusion list proposal

A validator is expected to propose a
[`SignedInclusionList`](./beacon-chain.md#signedinclusionlist) at the beginning
of any `slot` for which
`get_inclusion_committee_assignment(state, epoch, validator_index)` returns.

If a validator is in the current inclusion list committee, the validator should
create and broadcast the `signed_inclusion_list` to the global `inclusion_list`
subnet by `get_inclusion_list_submission_due_ms(epoch)` milliseconds into the
slot after processing the block for the current slot and confirming it as the
head. If no block is received by
`get_inclusion_list_submission_due_ms(epoch) - 1000` milliseconds into the slot,
the validator should run `get_head` to determine the local head and construct
and broadcast the inclusion list based on this local head by
`get_inclusion_list_submission_due_ms(epoch)` milliseconds into the slot.

#### Constructing the `SignedInclusionList`

The validator creates the `signed_inclusion_list` as follows:

- First, the validator creates the `inclusion_list`.
- Set `inclusion_list.slot` to the assigned slot returned by
  `get_inclusion_committee_assignment`.
- Set `inclusion_list.validator_index` to the validator's index.
- Set `inclusion_list.inclusion_list_committee_root` to the hash tree root of
  the committee that the validator is a member of.
- Set `inclusion_list.transactions` using the response from `ExecutionEngine`
  via `get_inclusion_list`.
- Sign the `inclusion_list` using the helper `get_inclusion_list_signature` and
  obtain the `signature`.
- Set `signed_inclusion_list.message` to `inclusion_list`.
- Set `signed_inclusion_list.signature` to `signature`.

```python
def get_inclusion_list_signature(
    state: BeaconState, inclusion_list: InclusionList, privkey: int
) -> BLSSignature:
    domain = get_domain(
        state, DOMAIN_INCLUSION_LIST_COMMITTEE, compute_epoch_at_slot(inclusion_list.slot)
    )
    signing_root = compute_signing_root(inclusion_list, domain)
    return bls.Sign(privkey, signing_root)
```

### Payload timeliness attestation

Some validators are selected to submit payload timeliness attestations.
Validators should call `get_ptc_assignment` at the beginning of an epoch to be
prepared to submit their PTC attestations during the next epoch.

A validator should create and broadcast the `payload_attestation_message` to the
global execution attestation subnet not after
`get_payload_attestation_due_ms(epoch)` milliseconds since the start of `slot`.

#### Constructing a payload attestation

If a validator is in the payload attestation committee for the current slot (as
obtained from `get_ptc_assignment` above) then the validator should prepare a
`PayloadAttestationMessage` for the current slot, according to the logic in
`get_payload_attestation_message` below and broadcast it not after
`get_payload_attestation_due_ms(epoch)` milliseconds since the start of the
slot, to the global `payload_attestation_message` pubsub topic.

The validator creates `payload_attestation_message` as follows:

- If the validator has not seen any beacon block for the assigned slot, do not
  submit a payload attestation. It will be ignored anyway.
- Set `data.beacon_block_root` be the HTR of the beacon block seen for the
  assigned slot
- Set `data.slot` to be the assigned slot.
- If a `SignedExecutionPayloadEnvelope` has been seen referencing the block
  `data.beacon_block_root` set `data.payload_present = True`. Otherwise set it
  to `False`.
- Set `payload_attestation_message.validator_index = validator_index` where
  `validator_index` is the validator chosen to submit. The private key mapping
  to `state.validators[validator_index].pubkey` is used to sign the payload
  timeliness attestation.
- Sign the `payload_attestation_message.data` using the helper
  `get_payload_attestation_message_signature`.

Notice that the attester only signs the `PayloadAttestationData` and not the
`validator_index` field in the message. Proposers need to aggregate these
attestations as described above.

```python
def get_payload_attestation_message_signature(
    state: BeaconState, attestation: PayloadAttestationMessage, privkey: int
) -> BLSSignature:
    domain = get_domain(state, DOMAIN_PTC_ATTESTER, compute_epoch_at_slot(attestation.data.slot))
    signing_root = compute_signing_root(attestation.data, domain)
    return bls.Sign(privkey, signing_root)
```

**Remark** Validators do not need to check the full validity of the
`ExecutionPayload` contained in within the envelope, but the checks in the
[P2P guide](./p2p-interface.md) should pass for the
`SignedExecutionPayloadEnvelope`.

## Modified functions

### Modified `prepare_execution_payload`

*Note*: The function `prepare_execution_payload` is modified to handle the
updated `get_expected_withdrawals` return signature.

*Note*: In this section, `state` is the state of the slot for the block proposal
_without_ the block yet applied. That is, `state` is the `previous_state`
processed through any empty slots up to the assigned slot using
`process_slots(previous_state, slot)`.

*Note*: The only change to `prepare_execution_payload` is to call
`get_inclusion_list_store` and `get_inclusion_list_transactions` to set the new
`inclusion_list_transactions` field of `PayloadAttributes`.

*Note*: A proposer should produce an execution payload that satisfies the
inclusion list constraints with respect to the inclusion lists gathered up to
`get_proposer_inclusion_list_cutoff_ms(epoch)` milliseconds into the slot.

```python
def prepare_execution_payload(
    state: BeaconState,
    safe_block_hash: Hash32,
    finalized_block_hash: Hash32,
    suggested_fee_recipient: ExecutionAddress,
    execution_engine: ExecutionEngine,
) -> Optional[PayloadId]:
    # Verify consistency of the parent hash with respect to the previous execution payload bid
    parent_hash = state.latest_execution_payload_bid.block_hash

    # [Modified in Gloas:EIP7732]
    # Set the forkchoice head and initiate the payload build process
    withdrawals, _, _ = get_expected_withdrawals(state)

    # [New in Gloas:EIP7805]
    # Get the inclusion list store
    inclusion_list_store = get_inclusion_list_store()

    payload_attributes = PayloadAttributes(
        timestamp=compute_time_at_slot(state, state.slot),
        prev_randao=get_randao_mix(state, get_current_epoch(state)),
        suggested_fee_recipient=suggested_fee_recipient,
        withdrawals=withdrawals,
        parent_beacon_block_root=hash_tree_root(state.latest_block_header),
        # [New in Gloas:EIP7805]
        inclusion_list_transactions=get_inclusion_list_transactions(
            inclusion_list_store, state, Slot(state.slot - 1)
        ),
    )
    return execution_engine.notify_forkchoice_updated(
        head_block_hash=parent_hash,
        safe_block_hash=safe_block_hash,
        finalized_block_hash=finalized_block_hash,
        payload_attributes=payload_attributes,
    )
```

## Data column sidecars

*[Modified in Gloas]*

### Modified `get_data_column_sidecars_from_column_sidecar`

```python
def get_data_column_sidecars_from_column_sidecar(
    sidecar: DataColumnSidecar,
    cells_and_kzg_proofs: Sequence[
        Tuple[Vector[Cell, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB], Vector[KZGProof, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB]]
    ],
) -> Sequence[DataColumnSidecar]:
    """
    Given a DataColumnSidecar and the cells/proofs associated with each blob corresponding
    to the commitments it contains, assemble all sidecars for distribution to peers.
    """
    assert len(cells_and_kzg_proofs) == len(sidecar.kzg_commitments)

    return get_data_column_sidecars(
        sidecar.beacon_block_root,
        sidecar.slot,
        sidecar.kzg_commitments,
        cells_and_kzg_proofs,
    )
```
