# Electra -- Networking

This document contains the consensus-layer networking specification for Electra.

The specification of these changes continues in the same format as the network specifications of previous upgrades, and assumes them as pre-requisite.

## Modifications in Electra

### The gossip domain: gossipsub

Some gossip meshes are upgraded in the fork of Electra to support upgraded types.

#### Topics and messages

Topics follow the same specification as in prior upgrades.

The `beacon_block` topic is modified to also support Electra blocks.

The `beacon_aggregate_and_proof` and `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}` topics are modified to support the gossip of the new attestation type.

The `attester_slashing` topic is modified to support the gossip of the new `AttesterSlashing` type.

The specification around the creation, validation, and dissemination of messages has not changed from the Capella document unless explicitly noted here.

The derivation of the `message-id` remains stable.

#### Global topics

##### `beacon_aggregate_and_proof`

The following convenience variables are re-defined
- `index = get_committee_indices(aggregate.committee_bits)[0]`

The following validations are added:
* [REJECT] `len(committee_indices) == 1`, where `committee_indices = get_committee_indices(aggregate)`.
* [REJECT] `aggregate.data.index == 0`

#### Attestation subnets

##### `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}`

The topic is updated to propagate `SingleAttestation` objects.

The following convenience variables are re-defined:
- `index = attestation.committee_index`

The following validations are added:
- _[REJECT]_ `attestation.data.index == 0`
- _[REJECT]_ The attester is a member of the committee -- i.e.
  `attestation.attester_index in get_beacon_committee(state, attestation.data.slot, index)`.

The following validations are removed:
- _[REJECT]_ The attestation is unaggregated --
  that is, it has exactly one participating validator (`len([bit for bit in aggregation_bits if bit]) == 1`, i.e. exactly 1 bit is set).
- _[REJECT]_ The number of aggregation bits matches the committee size -- i.e.
  `len(aggregation_bits) == len(get_beacon_committee(state, attestation.data.slot, index))`.
