## Introduction

This document represents the changes to be made in the code of an "honest validator" to implement Fulu.

## Prerequisites

This document is an extension of the [Electra -- Honest Validator](../electra/validator.md) guide.
All behaviors and definitions defined in this document, and documents it extends, carry over unless
explicitly noted or overridden.

All terminology, constants, functions, and protocol mechanics defined in [Fulu -- Beacon
Chain](./beacon-chain.md) and [Fulu -- Data Availability Sampling Core] are requisite for this
document and used throughout.

## Configuration

### Custody setting

| Name | Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `VALIDATOR_CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT` | `8` | Minimum number of custody groups an honest node with validators attached custodies and serves samples from |
| `BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP` | `Gwei(32 * 10**9)` | Effective balance increment corresponding to one additional group to custody |

## Helpers

### `BlobsBundle`

*[Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]*

The `BlobsBundle` object is modified to include cell KZG proofs instead of blob KZG proofs.

```python
@dataclass
class BlobsBundle(object):
    commitments: List[KZGCommitment, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]
    # [Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]
    proofs: List[KZGProof, FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB * MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]
    blobs: List[Blob, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]
```

### Modified `GetPayloadResponse`

*[Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]*

The `GetPayloadResponse` object is modified to use the updated `BlobsBundle` object.

```python
@dataclass
class GetPayloadResponse(object):
    execution_payload: ExecutionPayload
    block_value: uint256
    blobs_bundle: BlobsBundle  # [Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]
```

## Protocol

### `ExecutionEngine`

#### Modified `get_payload`

The `get_payload` method is modified to return the updated `GetPayloadResponse` object.

```python
def get_payload(self: ExecutionEngine, payload_id: PayloadId) -> GetPayloadResponse:
    """
    Return ExecutionPayload, uint256, BlobsBundle objects.
    """
    # pylint: disable=unused-argument
    ...
```

## Beacon chain responsibilities

### Validator custody

*[New in Fulu:EIP7594]*

A node with validators attached downloads and custodies a higher minimum of custody groups per slot,
determined by `get_validators_custody_requirement(state, validator_indices)`. Here, `state` is the
latest finalized `BeaconState` and `validator_indices` is the list of indices corresponding to validators
attached to the node. Any node with at least one validator attached, and with the sum of the
effective balances of all attached validators being `total_node_balance`, downloads and custodies
`total_node_balance // BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP` custody groups per slot, with a minimum
of `VALIDATOR_CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT` and of course a maximum of `NUMBER_OF_CUSTODY_GROUPS`. The node
SHOULD dynamically adjust its custody groups following any changes to the effective balances of
attached validators.

```python
def get_validators_custody_requirement(state: BeaconState, validator_indices: Sequence[ValidatorIndex]) -> uint64:
    total_node_balance = sum(state.validators[index].effective_balance for index in validator_indices)
    count = total_node_balance // BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP
    return min(max(count, VALIDATOR_CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT), NUMBER_OF_CUSTODY_GROUPS)
```

This higher custody is advertised in the node's Metadata by setting a higher `custody_group_count`
and in the node's ENR by setting a higher `custody_group_count`. As with the regular custody
requirement, a node with validators MAY still choose to custody, advertise and serve more than
this minimum. As with the regular custody requirement, a node MUST backfill columns when syncing. In
addition, when the validator custody requirement increases, due to an increase in the total
effective balance of the attached validators, a node MUST backfill columns from the new custody
groups. However, a node MAY wait to advertise a higher custody in its Metadata and ENR until
backfilling is complete.

*Note*: The node SHOULD manage validator custody (and any changes during its lifetime) without any
input from the user, for example by using existing signals about validator metadata to compute the
required custody.

### Block and sidecar proposal

#### Constructing the sidecars

*[New in Fulu:EIP7594]*

For a block proposal, blobs associated with a block are packaged into many `DataColumnSidecar`
objects for distribution to the associated sidecar topic, the `data_column_sidecar_{subnet_id}`
pubsub topic. A `DataColumnSidecar` can be viewed as vertical slice of all blobs stacked on top of
each other, with extra fields for the necessary context.

##### `get_data_column_sidecars`

The sequence of sidecars associated with a block and can be obtained by first computing
`cells_and_kzg_proofs = [compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs(blob) for blob in blobs]` and then calling
`get_data_column_sidecars_from_block(signed_block, cells_and_kzg_proofs)`.

Moreover, the full sequence of sidecars can also be computed from `cells_and_kzg_proofs` and any single
`sidecar`, by calling `get_data_column_sidecars_from_column_sidecar(sidecar, cells_and_kzg_proofs)`.
This can be used in distributed blob publishing, to reconstruct all sidecars from any sidecar received
on the wire, assuming all cells and kzg proofs could be retrieved from the local execution layer client.

```python
def get_data_column_sidecars(
    signed_block_header: SignedBeaconBlockHeader,
    kzg_commitments: List[KZGCommitment, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK],
    kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof: Vector[Bytes32, KZG_COMMITMENTS_INCLUSION_PROOF_DEPTH],
    cells_and_kzg_proofs: Sequence[Tuple[
        Vector[Cell, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB],
        Vector[KZGProof, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB]
    ]]
) -> Sequence[DataColumnSidecar]:
    """
    Given a signed block header and the commitments, inclusion proof, cells/proofs associated with
    each blob in the block, assemble the sidecars which can be distributed to peers.
    """
    assert len(cells_and_kzg_proofs) == len(kzg_commitments)

    sidecars = []
    for column_index in range(NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS):
        column_cells, column_proofs = [], []
        for cells, proofs in cells_and_kzg_proofs:
            column_cells.append(cells[column_index])
            column_proofs.append(proofs[column_index])
        sidecars.append(DataColumnSidecar(
            index=column_index,
            column=column_cells,
            kzg_commitments=kzg_commitments,
            kzg_proofs=column_proofs,
            signed_block_header=signed_block_header,
            kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof=kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof,
        ))
    return sidecars
```

##### `get_data_column_sidecars_from_block`

```python
def get_data_column_sidecars_from_block(
    signed_block: SignedBeaconBlock,
    cells_and_kzg_proofs: Sequence[Tuple[
        Vector[Cell, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB],
        Vector[KZGProof, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB]
    ]]
) -> Sequence[DataColumnSidecar]:
    """
    Given a signed block and the cells/proofs associated with each blob in the
    block, assemble the sidecars which can be distributed to peers.
    """
    blob_kzg_commitments = signed_block.message.body.blob_kzg_commitments
    signed_block_header = compute_signed_block_header(signed_block)
    kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof = compute_merkle_proof(
        signed_block.message.body,
        get_generalized_index(BeaconBlockBody, 'blob_kzg_commitments'),
    )
    return get_data_column_sidecars(
        signed_block_header,
        blob_kzg_commitments,
        kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof,
        cells_and_kzg_proofs
    )
```

##### `get_data_column_sidecars_from_column_sidecar`

```python
def get_data_column_sidecars_from_column_sidecar(
    sidecar: DataColumnSidecar,
    cells_and_kzg_proofs: Sequence[Tuple[
        Vector[Cell, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB],
        Vector[KZGProof, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB]
    ]]
) -> Sequence[DataColumnSidecar]:
    """
    Given a DataColumnSidecar and the cells/proofs associated with each blob corresponding
    to the commitments it contains, assemble all sidecars for distribution to peers.
    """
    assert len(cells_and_kzg_proofs) == len(sidecar.kzg_commitments)

    return get_data_column_sidecars(
        sidecar.signed_block_header,
        sidecar.kzg_commitments,
        sidecar.kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof,
        cells_and_kzg_proofs
    )
```

#### Sidecar publishing

The `subnet_id` for the `data_column_sidecar` is calculated with:

- Let `column_index = data_column_sidecar.index`.
- Let `subnet_id = compute_subnet_for_data_column_sidecar(column_index)`.

After publishing all columns to their respective subnets, peers on the network may request the
sidecar through sync-requests, or a local user may be interested.

#### Sidecar retention

The validator MUST hold on to sidecars for `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_DATA_COLUMN_SIDECARS_REQUESTS` epochs and
serve when capable, to ensure the data-availability of these blobs throughout the network.

After `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_DATA_COLUMN_SIDECARS_REQUESTS` nodes MAY prune the sidecars and/or stop
serving them.
