## Introduction

This document represents the changes to be made in the code of an "honest validator" to implement Fulu.

## Prerequisites

This document is an extension of the [Electra -- Honest Validator](../electra/validator.md) guide.
All behaviors and definitions defined in this document, and documents it extends, carry over unless
explicitly noted or overridden.

All terminology, constants, functions, and protocol mechanics defined in [Fulu -- Beacon
Chain](./beacon-chain.md) and [Fulu -- Data Availability Sampling Core] are requisite for this
document and used throughout.

## Configuration

### Custody setting

| Name | Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `VALIDATOR_CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT` | `8` | Minimum number of custody groups an honest node with validators attached custodies and serves samples from |
| `BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP` | `Gwei(32 * 10**9)` | Balance increment corresponding to one additional group to custody |

## Helpers

### `BlobsBundle`

*[Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]*

The `BlobsBundle` object is modified to include cell KZG proofs instead of blob KZG proofs.

```python
@dataclass
class BlobsBundle(object):
    commitments: List[KZGCommitment, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]
    # [Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]
    proofs: List[KZGProof, FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB * MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]
    blobs: List[Blob, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]
```

### Modified `GetPayloadResponse`

*[Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]*

The `GetPayloadResponse` object is modified to use the updated `BlobsBundle` object.

```python
@dataclass
class GetPayloadResponse(object):
    execution_payload: ExecutionPayload
    block_value: uint256
    blobs_bundle: BlobsBundle  # [Modified in Fulu:EIP7594]
```

## Protocol

### `ExecutionEngine`

#### Modified `get_payload`

The `get_payload` method is modified to return the updated `GetPayloadResponse` object.

```python
def get_payload(self: ExecutionEngine, payload_id: PayloadId) -> GetPayloadResponse:
    """
    Return ExecutionPayload, uint256, BlobsBundle objects.
    """
    # pylint: disable=unused-argument
    ...
```

## Beacon chain responsibilities

### Validator custody

*[New in Fulu:EIP7594]*

A node with validators attached downloads and custodies a higher minimum of custody groups per slot,
determined by `get_validators_custody_requirement(state, validator_indices)`. Here, `state` is the
current `BeaconState` and `validator_indices` is the list of indices corresponding to validators
attached to the node. Any node with at least one validator attached, and with the sum of the
balances of all attached validators being `total_node_balance`, downloads and custodies
`total_node_balance // BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP` custody groups per slot, with a minimum
of `VALIDATOR_CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT` and of course a maximum of `NUMBER_OF_CUSTODY_GROUPS`.

```python
def get_validators_custody_requirement(state: BeaconState, validator_indices: Sequence[ValidatorIndex]) -> uint64:
    total_node_balance = sum(state.balances[index] for index in validator_indices)
    count = total_node_balance // BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP
    return min(max(count, VALIDATOR_CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT), NUMBER_OF_CUSTODY_GROUPS)
```

This higher custody is advertised in the node's Metadata by setting a higher `custody_group_count`
and in the node's ENR by setting a higher `custody_group_count`. As with the regular custody
requirement, a node with validators *may* still choose to custody, advertise and serve more than
this minimum. As with the regular custody requirement, a node MUST backfill columns when syncing. In
addition, when the validator custody requirement increases, due to an increase in the total balance
of the attached validators, a node MUST backfill columns from the new custody groups. However, a
node *may* wait to advertise a higher custody in its Metadata and ENR until backfilling is complete.

### Block and sidecar proposal

#### Constructing the sidecars

*[New in Fulu:EIP7594]*

For a block proposal, blobs associated with a block are packaged into many `DataColumnSidecar`
objects for distribution to the associated sidecar topic, the `data_column_sidecar_{subnet_id}`
pubsub topic. A `DataColumnSidecar` can be viewed as vertical slice of all blobs stacked on top of
each other, with extra fields for the necessary context.

##### `get_data_column_sidecars`

The sequence of sidecars associated with a block and can be obtained by first computing
`cells_and_kzg_proofs = [compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs(blob) for blob in blobs]` and then calling
`get_data_column_sidecars(signed_block, cells_and_kzg_proofs)`.

```python
def get_data_column_sidecars(signed_block: SignedBeaconBlock,
                             cells_and_kzg_proofs: Sequence[Tuple[
        Vector[Cell, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB],
        Vector[KZGProof, CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB]]]) -> Sequence[DataColumnSidecar]:
    """
    Given a signed block and the cells/proofs associated with each blob in the
    block, assemble the sidecars which can be distributed to peers.
    """
    blob_kzg_commitments = signed_block.message.body.blob_kzg_commitments
    assert len(cells_and_kzg_proofs) == len(blob_kzg_commitments)
    signed_block_header = compute_signed_block_header(signed_block)
    kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof = compute_merkle_proof(
        signed_block.message.body,
        get_generalized_index(BeaconBlockBody, 'blob_kzg_commitments'),
    )

    sidecars = []
    for column_index in range(NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS):
        column_cells, column_proofs = [], []
        for cells, proofs in cells_and_kzg_proofs:
            column_cells.append(cells[column_index])
            column_proofs.append(proofs[column_index])
        sidecars.append(DataColumnSidecar(
            index=column_index,
            column=column_cells,
            kzg_commitments=blob_kzg_commitments,
            kzg_proofs=column_proofs,
            signed_block_header=signed_block_header,
            kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof=kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof,
        ))
    return sidecars
```

#### Sidecar publishing

The `subnet_id` for the `data_column_sidecar` is calculated with:

- Let `column_index = data_column_sidecar.index`.
- Let `subnet_id = compute_subnet_for_data_column_sidecar(column_index)`.

After publishing all columns to their respective subnets, peers on the network may request the
sidecar through sync-requests, or a local user may be interested.

#### Sidecar retention

The validator MUST hold on to sidecars for `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_DATA_COLUMN_SIDECARS_REQUESTS` epochs and
serve when capable, to ensure the data-availability of these blobs throughout the network.

After `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_DATA_COLUMN_SIDECARS_REQUESTS` nodes MAY prune the sidecars and/or stop
serving them.
