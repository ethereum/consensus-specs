To learn more about sharding and Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), see the [sharding FAQ](https://eth.wiki/sharding/Sharding-FAQs) and the [research compendium](https://notes.ethereum.org/s/H1PGqDhpm).

This repository hosts the current Eth2 specifications. Discussions about design rationale and proposed changes can be brought up and discussed as issues. Solidified, agreed-upon changes to the spec can be made through pull requests.

## Specs

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ethereum/eth2.0-specs)](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/releases/) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/eth2spec.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/eth2spec)

Core specifications for Eth2 clients be found in [specs](specs/). These are divided into features.
Features are researched and developed in parallel, and then consolidated into sequential upgrades when ready.

The current features are:

### Phase 0

- [The Beacon Chain](specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)
- [Beacon Chain Fork Choice](specs/phase0/fork-choice.md)
- [Deposit Contract](specs/phase0/deposit-contract.md)
- [Honest Validator](specs/phase0/validator.md)
- [P2P Networking](specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md)

### Altair

- [Beacon chain changes](specs/altair/beacon-chain.md)
- [Altair fork](specs/altair/fork.md)
- [Light client sync protocol](specs/altair/sync-protocol.md)
- [Honest Validator guide changes](specs/altair/validator.md)

### Merge

The merge is still actively in R&D. The specifications outline a general direction for engineering work,
while the details are in review and may change.

- Background material:
  - An [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch) post [describing the basic mechanism](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-eth1-eth2-transition/6265)
  - [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) high-level description of the merge [here](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/docking/)
- Specifications:
  - [Beacon Chain changes](specs/merge/beacon-chain.md)
  - [Fork Choice changes](specs/merge/fork-choice.md)
  - [Validator additions](specs/merge/validator.md)

### Sharding

Sharding follows the merge, and is divided into three parts:

- Sharding base functionality - In early engineering phase
  - [Beacon Chain changes](specs/sharding/beacon-chain.md)
  - [P2P Network changes](specs/sharding/p2p-interface.md)
- Custody Game - Ready, dependent on sharding
  - [Beacon Chain changes](specs/custody_game/beacon-chain.md)
  - [Validator custody work](specs/custody_game/validator.md)
- Data Availability Sampling - In active R&D
  - Technical details [here](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/B1YJPGkpD).
  - [Core types and functions](specs/das/das-core.md)
  - [P2P Networking](specs/das/p2p-interface.md)
  - [Fork Choice](specs/das/fork-choice.md)
  - [Sampling process](specs/das/sampling.md)

### Accompanying documents can be found in [specs](specs) and include:

- [SimpleSerialize (SSZ) spec](ssz/simple-serialize.md)
- [Merkle proof formats](ssz/merkle-proofs.md)
- [General test format](tests/formats/README.md)

## Additional specifications for client implementers

Additional specifications and standards outside of requisite client functionality can be found in the following repos:

- [Eth2 APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-apis)
- [Eth2 Metrics](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-metrics/)
- [Interop Standards in Eth2 PM](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/tree/master/interop)

## Design goals

The following are the broad design goals for Ethereum 2.0:

- to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency
- to remain live through major network partitions and when very large portions of nodes go offline
- to select all components such that they are either quantum secure or can be easily swapped out for quantum secure counterparts when available
- to utilize crypto and design techniques that allow for a large participation of validators in total and per unit time
- to allow for a typical consumer laptop with `O(C)` resources to process/validate `O(1)` shards (including any system level validation such as the beacon chain)

## Useful external resources

- [Design Rationale](https://notes.ethereum.org/s/rkhCgQteN)
- [Phase 0 Onboarding Document](https://notes.ethereum.org/s/Bkn3zpwxB)
- [Combining GHOST and Casper paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052)
