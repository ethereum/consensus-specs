# Sanity tests

The aim of the sanity tests is to set a base-line on what really needs to pass, i.e. the essentials.

There are two handlers, documented individually:
- [`slots`](./slots.md): transitions of one or more slots (and epoch transitions within)
- [`blocks`](./blocks.md): transitions triggered by one or more blocks
