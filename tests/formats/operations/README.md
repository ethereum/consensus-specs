# Operations tests

The different kinds of operations ("transactions") are tested individually with test handlers.

## Test case format

### `meta.yaml`

```yaml
description: string    -- Optional description of test case, purely for debugging purposes.
                          Tests should use the directory name of the test case as identifier, not the description.
bls_setting: int       -- see general test-format spec.
```

### `pre.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy encoded `BeaconState`, the state before applying the operation.

### `<input-name>.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy encoded operation object, e.g. a `ProposerSlashing`, or `Deposit`.

### `post.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy encoded `BeaconState`, the state after applying the operation. No value if operation processing is aborted.


## Condition

A handler of the `operations` test-runner should process these cases,
 calling the corresponding processing implementation.
This excludes the other parts of the block-transition.

Operations:

| *`operation-name`*        | *`operation-object`*         | *`input name`*      | *`processing call`*                                                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `attestation`             | `Attestation`                | `attestation`       | `process_attestation(state, attestation)`                                        |
| `attester_slashing`       | `AttesterSlashing`           | `attester_slashing` | `process_attester_slashing(state, attester_slashing)`                            |
| `block_header`            | `BeaconBlock`                | **`block`**         | `process_block_header(state, block)`                                             |
| `deposit`                 | `Deposit`                    | `deposit`           | `process_deposit(state, deposit)`                                                |
| `proposer_slashing`       | `ProposerSlashing`           | `proposer_slashing` | `process_proposer_slashing(state, proposer_slashing)`                            |
| `voluntary_exit`          | `SignedVoluntaryExit`        | `voluntary_exit`    | `process_voluntary_exit(state, voluntary_exit)`                                  |
| `sync_aggregate`          | `SyncAggregate`              | `sync_aggregate`    | `process_sync_aggregate(state, sync_aggregate)` (new in Altair)                  |
| `execution_payload`       | `ExecutionPayload`           | `execution_payload` | `process_execution_payload(state, execution_payload)` (new in Bellatrix)         |
| `withdrawals`             | `ExecutionPayload`           | `execution_payload` | `process_withdrawals(state, execution_payload)` (new in Capella)                 |
| `bls_to_execution_change` | `SignedBLSToExecutionChange` | `address_change`    | `process_bls_to_execution_change(state, address_change)` (new in Capella) |
| `deposit_receipt`         | `DepositReceipt`             | `deposit_receipt`   | `process_deposit_receipt(state, deposit_receipt)` (new in EIP6110)               |

Note that `block_header` is not strictly an operation (and is a full `Block`), but processed in the same manner, and hence included here.

The `execution_payload` processing normally requires a `verify_execution_state_transition(execution_payload)`,
a responsibility of an (external) execution engine.
During testing this execution is mocked, an `execution.yml` is provided instead:
a dict containing an `execution_valid` boolean field with the verification result.

The resulting state should match the expected `post` state, or if the `post` state is left blank,
 the handler should reject the input operation as invalid.
