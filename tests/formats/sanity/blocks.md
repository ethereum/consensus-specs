# Sanity blocks testing

Sanity tests to cover a series of one or more blocks being processed, aiming to cover common changes.

## Test case format

### `meta.yaml`

```yaml
description: string            -- Optional. Description of test case, purely for debugging purposes.
bls_setting: int               -- see general test-format spec.
reveal_deadlines_setting: int  -- see general test-format spec.
blocks_count: int              -- the number of blocks processed in this test.
```

### `pre.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy encoded `BeaconState`, the state before running the block transitions.

### `blocks_<index>.ssz_snappy`

A series of files, with `<index>` in range `[0, blocks_count)`. Blocks need to be processed in order,
 following the main transition function (i.e. process slot and epoch transitions in between blocks as normal)

Each file is a SSZ-snappy encoded `SignedBeaconBlock`.

### `post.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy encoded `BeaconState`, the state after applying the block transitions.

## Condition

The resulting state should match the expected `post` state, or if the `post` state is left blank,
 the handler should reject the series of blocks as invalid.
