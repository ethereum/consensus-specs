# Sanity slots testing

Sanity tests to cover a series of one or more empty-slot transitions being processed, aiming to cover common changes.

## Test case format

### `meta.yaml`

```yaml
description: string    -- Optional. Description of test case, purely for debugging purposes.
bls_setting: int       -- see general test-format spec.
```

### `pre.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy `BeaconState`, the state before running the transitions.

Also available as `pre.ssz_snappy`.

### `slots.yaml`

An integer. The amount of slots to process (i.e. the difference in slots between pre and post), always a positive number.

### `post.ssz_snappy`

An SSZ-snappy `BeaconState`, the state after applying the transitions.

Also available as `post.ssz_snappy`.

### Processing

The transition with pure time, no blocks, is known as `process_slots(state, slot)` in the spec.
This runs state-caching (pure slot transition) and epoch processing (every E slots).

To process the data, call `process_slots(pre, pre.slot + N)`.

## Condition

The resulting state should match the expected `post` state.
