### Execution Payload Bid

Handler: `execution_payload_bid`

#### `test_process_execution_payload_bid_valid_self_build`

##### Status

Implemented ✅

##### Description

Proposer can self-build by submitting a bid with their own validator index and
zero value.

##### Scenario

Proposer creates a valid execution payload bid with `builder_index` equal to
`proposer_index` and `value = 0`.

##### Expectation

Bid is accepted, `latest_execution_payload_bid` is updated in state, and no
pending payment is created since `value` is zero.

#### `test_process_execution_payload_bid_valid_builder`

##### Status

Implemented ✅

##### Description

Registered builder can submit a valid bid with non-zero value.

##### Scenario

A validator with builder withdrawal credentials (0x03) submits a bid with
sufficient balance to cover the bid value plus `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE` and any
pending payments/withdrawals.

##### Expectation

Bid is accepted, `latest_execution_payload_bid` is updated, builder balance
remains unchanged, and a pending payment is created in the
`builder_pending_payments` queue with `weight = 0` and
`withdrawable_epoch = FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH`.

#### `test_process_execution_payload_bid_valid_builder_zero_value`

##### Status

Implemented ✅

##### Description

##### Status

Implemented ✅

##### Description

Attestation does not get `TIMELY_HEAD_FLAG` when payload doesn't match, even if
blockroot matches.

##### Scenario

Submit an attestation where `is_matching_blockroot = True` but
`is_matching_payload = False`.

##### Description

Builder payment is NOT deleted when slashing comes more than two epochs after
the proposal.

##### Scenario

Create a builder pending payment, advance more than two epochs, then slash the
proposer.

epoch is cleared (all zeros).

#### `test_process_builder_pending_payments_large_amount_churn_impact`

##### Status

Implemented ✅

##### Description
