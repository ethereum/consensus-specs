| `test_inclusion_list_store_transaction_uniqueness`     | Stored IL transactions should be unique                                                               | Process empty, non-empty and full-sized ILs. Some ILs have overlapping transactions.     | All ILs should be processed successfully and all transactions in the IL store should be unique.                                                                                                                                                                        | ✅     |
| `test_inclusion_list_store_by_slot_and_committee_root` | ILs are stored by slot and IL committee root                                                          | Process ILs with the same slot but different IL committee roots.                         | Fetching ILs by slot and IL committee root should return ILs with the given slot and IL committee root.                                                                                                                                                                | ✅     |
| `test_inclusion_list_store_equivocation`               | ILs from equivocators should not be stored                                                            | Process ILs, two of which are equivocations.                                             | The first IL from an equivocator should be stored successfully, which should be removed from the IL store after processing the second IL from the equivocator. Subsequent ILs from the equivocator should be ignored. Any non-equivocating ILs should not be affected. | ✅     |
| `test_inclusion_list_store_equivocation_scope`         | Equivocation consequences are slot-bound: equivocators are allowed to participate in subsequent slots | Equivocate and then participate in the next slot.                                        | All ILs from the equivocator in that slot should be ignored. However, a non-equivocating IL from the equivocator in the next slot should be stored.                                                                                                                    | ✅     |
| `test_inclusion_list_store_view_freeze_cutoff`         | ILs received after the view freeze cutoff should be ignored unless it's an equivocation               | Process ILs before and after the view freeze cutoff while equivocating after the cutoff. | An IL received after the view freeze cutoff should not be stored. An equivocation detected after the cutoff should be handled.                                                                                                                                         | ✅     |
