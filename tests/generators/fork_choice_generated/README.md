# Fork choice compliance test generator

Fork Choice test generator intended to produce tests to validate conformance to the specs of various Fork Choice implementations.

Implementation of the approach described in the [Fork Choice compliance testing framework](https://hackmd.io/@ericsson49/fork-choice-implementation-vs-spec-testing).

Preliminary research has been also performed in this [repo](https://github.com/txrx-research/fork_choice_test_generation/tree/main).

To simplfy adoption of the tests, we follow the test format described in the [fork choice test formats documentation](../../formats/fork_choice/README.md), with a minor exception (new check added).
