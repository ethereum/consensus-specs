# Executable Python Spec (PySpec)

The executable Python spec is built from the consensus specifications,
 complemented with the necessary helper functions for hashing, BLS, and more.

With this executable spec,
 test-generators can easily create test-vectors for client implementations,
 and the spec itself can be verified to be consistent and coherent through sanity tests implemented with pytest.

## Py-tests

These tests are not intended for client-consumption.
These tests are testing the spec itself, to verify consistency and provide feedback on modifications of the spec.
However, most of the tests can be run in generator-mode, to output test vectors for client-consumption.

### How to run tests

To run all tests:
```shell
make test
```

To run all tests under the minimal preset:
```shell
make test preset=minimal
```

Or, to run a specific test function specify `k=<test-name>`:
```shell
make test k=test_verify_kzg_proof
```

Or, to run a specific test function under a single fork specify `k=<test-name>`:
```shell
make test fork=phase0
```

Note: these options can be used together, like:

```shell
make test preset=minimal k=test_verify_kzg_proof fork=deneb
```

### How to view code coverage report

Run `make coverage` to run all tests and open the html code coverage report.
