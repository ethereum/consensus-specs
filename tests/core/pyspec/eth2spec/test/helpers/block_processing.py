    Processes to the block transition, up to, but not including, the sub-transition named ``process_name``.
    Returns a Callable[[state, block], None] for the remaining ``process_name`` transition.

    Tests should create full blocks to ensure a valid state transition, even if the operation itself is isolated.
    (e.g. latest_header in the beacon state is up-to-date in a sync-committee test).

    A test prepares a pre-state by calling this function, output the pre-state,
     and it can then proceed to run the returned callable, and output a post-state.
