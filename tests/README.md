# Getting Started with Consensus Spec Tests

## Getting Started

### Creating the environment

Use an OS that has Python 3.8 or above. For example, Debian 11 (bullseye)

1. Install the packages you need:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y make git wget python3-venv gcc python3-dev
   ```
2. Download the latest [consensus specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs)
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs.git
   cd consensus-specs
   ```
3. Create the specifications and tests:   
   ```sh
   make install_test
   make pyspec
   ```

To read more about creating the environment, [see here](core/pyspec/README.md).

### Running your first test


1. Enter the virtual Python environment:
   ```sh
   cd ~/consensus-specs
   . venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Run a sanity check test against Altair fork:
   ```sh 
   cd tests/core/pyspec
   python -m pytest -k test_empty_block_transition --fork altair eth2spec
   ```
3. The output should be similar to:
   ```

## The "Hello, World" of Consensus Spec Tests

One of the `test_empty_block_transition` tests is implemented by a function with the same
name located in 
[`~/consensus-specs/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/sanity/test_blocks.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/sanity/test_blocks.py).
To learn how consensus spec tests are written, let's go over the code:

```python
@with_all_phases
```

This [decorator](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/decorators.html) specifies that this test
is applicable to all the phases of consensus layer development. These phases are similar to forks (Istanbul,
Berlin, London, etc.) in the execution blockchain. If you are interested, [you can see the definition of
this decorator here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/context.py#L331-L335).

```python
@spec_state_test
```

[This decorator](https://github.com/qbzzt/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/context.py#L232-L234) specifies
that this test is a state transition test, and that it does not include a transition between different forks.

```python
def test_empty_block_transition(spec, state):
```

This type of test receives two parameters:

* `specs`: The protocol specifications
* `state`: The genesis state before the test

```python
    pre_slot = state.slot
```    

A slot is a unit of time (every 12 seconds in mainnet), for which a specific validator (selected randomly but in a
deterministic manner) is a proposer. The proposer can propose a block during that slot. 

```python
    pre_eth1_votes = len(state.eth1_data_votes)
    pre_mix = spec.get_randao_mix(state, spec.get_current_epoch(state))
```

Store some values to check later that certain updates happened.

```python
    yield 'pre', state
```

In Python `yield` is used by [generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators). However, for our purposes
we can treat it as a partial return statement that doesn't stop the function's processing, only adds to a list
of return values. Here we add two values, the string `'pre'` and the initial state, to the list of return values.

[You can read more about test generators and how they are used here](generators).

```python
    block = build_empty_block_for_next_slot(spec, state)
```

The state contains the last block, which is necessary for building up the next block (every block needs to
have the hash of the previous one in a blockchain).

```python
    signed_block = state_transition_and_sign_block(spec, state, block)
```

Create a block signed by the appropriate proposer and advance the state.

```python
    yield 'blocks', [signed_block]
    yield 'post', state
```

More `yield` statements. The output of a consensus test is:

1. `'pre'`
2. The state before the test was run
3. `'blocks'`
4. A list of signed blocks
5. `'post'`
6. The state after the test



```python
    # One vote for the eth1
    assert len(state.eth1_data_votes) == pre_eth1_votes + 1

    # Check that the new parent root is correct
    assert spec.get_block_root_at_slot(state, pre_slot) == signed_block.message.parent_root
    
    # Random data changed
    assert spec.get_randao_mix(state, spec.get_current_epoch(state)) != pre_mix
```

Finally we assertions that test the transition was legitimate. In this case we have three assertions:

1. One item was added to `eth1_data_votes`
2. The new block's `parent_root` is the same as the block in the previous location
3. The random data that every block includes was changed. 


## New Tests

The easiest way to write a new test is to copy and modify an existing one. For example,
lets write a test where the first slot of the beacon chain is empty (because the assigned 
proposer is offline, for example), and then there's an empty block in the second slot.

We already know how to accomplish most of what we need for this test, but the only way we know 
to advance the state is `state_transition_and_sign_block`, a function that also puts a block
into the slot. So let's see if the function's definition tells us how to advance the state without
a block.

First, we need to find out where the function is located. Run:

```sh
find . -name '*.py' -exec grep 'def state_transition_and_sign_block' {} \; -print
```

And you'll find that the function is defined in 
[`eth2spec/test/helpers/state.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/helpers/state.py). Looking
in that file, we see that the second function is:

```python
def next_slot(spec, state):
    """
    Transition to the next slot.
    """
    spec.process_slots(state, state.slot + 1)
```

This looks like exactly what we need. So we add this call before we create the empty block:


```python
.
.
.
    yield 'pre', state

    next_slot(spec, state)

    block = build_empty_block_for_next_slot(spec, state)
.
.
.
```

That's it. Our new test works (copy `test_empty_block_transition`, rename it, add the `next_slot` call, and then run it to 
verify this).



## Tests Designed to Fail

It is important to make sure that the system rejects invalid input, so our next step is to deal with cases where the protocol
is supposed to reject something. To see such a test, look at `test_prev_slot_block_transition` (in the same
file we used previously, 
[`~/consensus-specs/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/sanity/test_blocks.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/sanity/test_blocks.py)).

```python
@with_all_phases
@spec_state_test
def test_prev_slot_block_transition(spec, state):
    spec.process_slots(state, state.slot + 1)
    block = build_empty_block(spec, state, slot=state.slot)
```

Build an empty block for the current slot.

```python
    proposer_index = spec.get_beacon_proposer_index(state)
```

Get the identity of the current proposer, the one for *this* slot.

```python
    spec.process_slots(state, state.slot + 1)
```

Transition to the new slot, which naturally has a different proposer.

```python
    yield 'pre', state
    expect_assertion_error(lambda: transition_unsigned_block(spec, state, block))
```

Specify that the function `transition_unsigned_block` will cause an assertion error.
You can see this function in 
[`~/consensus-specs/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/helpers/block.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/helpers/block.py),
and one of the tests is that the block must be for this slot:
> ```python
> assert state.slot == block.slot
>  ```

Because we use [lambda notation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp), the test
does not call `transition_unsigned_block` here. Instead, this is a function parameter that can
be called later.

```python
    block.state_root = state.hash_tree_root()
```

Set the block's state root to the current state hash tree root, which identifies this block as
belonging to this slot (even though it was created for the previous slot). 

```python    
    signed_block = sign_block(spec, state, block, proposer_index=proposer_index)
```

Notice that `proposer_index` is the variable we set earlier, *before* we advanced
the slot with `spec.process_slots(state, state.slot + 1)`. It is not the proposer 
for the current state.

```python
    yield 'blocks', [signed_block]
    yield 'post', None   # No post state, signifying it errors out
```

This is the way we specify that a test is designed to fail - failed tests have no post state,
because the processing mechanism errors out before creating it.


## Attestation Tests

The consensus layer doesn't provide any direct functionality to end users. It does
not execute EVM programs or store user data. It exists to provide a secure source of
information about the latest verified block hash of the execution layer.

For every slot a validator is randomly selected as the proposer. The proposer proposes a block
for the current head of the consensus layer chain (built on the previous block). That block 
includes the hash of the proposed new head of the execution layer.

For every slot there is also a randomly selected committee of validators that needs to vote whether
the new consensus layer block is valid, which requires the proposed head of the execution chain to
also be a valid block. These votes are called [attestations](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/aggregation#112-Attestation), 
and they are sent as independent messages. The proposer for a block is able to include attestations from previous slots, 
which is how they get on chain to form consensus, reward honest validators, etc.

[You can see a simple successful attestation test here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/926e5a3d722df973b9a12f12c015783de35cafa9/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/block_processing/test_process_attestation.py#L26-L30):
Lets go over it line by line.


```python
@with_all_phases
@spec_state_test
def test_success(spec, state):
    attestation = get_valid_attestation(spec, state, signed=True)
```

[This function](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/30fe7ba1107d976100eb0c3252ca7637b791e43a/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/helpers/attestations.py#L88-L120)
creates a valid attestation (which can then be modified to make it invalid if needed).
To see an attestion "from the inside" we need to follow it.


> ```python
>  def get_valid_attestation(spec,
>                           state,
>                           slot=None,
>                           index=None,
>                           filter_participant_set=None,
>                           signed=False):

> 
>    return attestation  
>  ```

```python
    next_slots(spec, state, spec.MIN_ATTESTATION_INCLUSION_DELAY)
```

Attestations have to appear after the block they attest for, so we advance 
`spec.MIN_ATTESTATION_INCLUSION_DELAY` slots before creating the block that includes the attestation.
Currently a single block is sufficient, but that may change in the future.

```python
    yield from run_attestation_processing(spec, state, attestation)
```

[This function](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/30fe7ba1107d976100eb0c3252ca7637b791e43a/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/helpers/attestations.py#L13-L50) 
processes the attestation and returns the result.


### Adding an Attestation Test

Attestations can't happen in the same block as the one about which they are attesting, or in a block that is
after the block is finalized. This is specified as part of the specs, in the `process_attestation` function
(which is created from the spec by the `make pyspec` command you ran earlier). Here is the relevant code
fragment:


```python
def process_attestation(state: BeaconState, attestation: Attestation) -> None:
    data = attestation.data
    assert data.target.epoch in (get_previous_epoch(state), get_current_epoch(state))
    assert data.target.epoch == compute_epoch_at_slot(data.slot)
    assert data.slot + MIN_ATTESTATION_INCLUSION_DELAY <= state.slot <= data.slot + SLOTS_PER_EPOCH
    ...
```

In the last line you can see two conditions being asserted:

1. `data.slot + MIN_ATTESTATION_INCLUSION_DELAY <= state.slot` which verifies that the attestation doesn't
   arrive too early.
2. `state.slot <= data.slot + SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` which verifies that the attestation doesn't
   arrive too late.
   
This is how the consensus layer tests deal with edge cases, by asserting the conditions required for the
values to be legitimate. In the case of these particular conditions, they are tested 
[here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/926e5a3d722df973b9a12f12c015783de35cafa9/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/block_processing/test_process_attestation.py#L87-L104).
One test checks what happens if the attestation is too early, and another if it is too late.

However, it is not enough to ensure we reject invalid blocks. It is also necessary to ensure we accept all valid blocks. You saw earlier
a test (`test_success`) that tested that being `MIN_ATTESTATION_INCLUSION_DELAY` after the data for which we attest is enough. 
Now we'll write a similar test that verifies that being `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` away is still valid. To do this, we modify the 
`test_after_epoch_slots` function. We need two changes:

1. Call `transition_to_slot_via_block` with one less slot to advance
2. Don't tell `run_attestation_processing` to return an empty post state.

The modified function is:

```python
@with_all_phases
@spec_state_test
def test_almost_after_epoch_slots(spec, state):
    attestation = get_valid_attestation(spec, state, signed=True)

    # increment to latest inclusion slot (not beyond it)
    transition_to_slot_via_block(spec, state, state.slot + spec.SLOTS_PER_EPOCH)

    yield from run_attestation_processing(spec, state, attestation)
```    

Add this function to the file `consensus-specs/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/phase0/block_processing/test_process_attestation.py`,
and run the test against Altair fork:

```sh
cd ~/consensus-specs
. venv/bin/activate
cd tests/core/pyspec
python -m pytest -k almost_after --fork altair eth2spec
```

You should see it ran successfully (although you might get a warning, you can ignore it)

## How are These Tests Used?

So far we've ran tests against the formal specifications. This is a way to check the specifications
are what we expect, but it doesn't actually check the beacon chain clients. The way these tests get applied
by clients is that every few weeks 
[new test specifications are released](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-spec-tests/releases),
in a format [documented here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/tests/formats).
All the consensus layer clients implement test-runners that consume the test vectors in this standard format.
